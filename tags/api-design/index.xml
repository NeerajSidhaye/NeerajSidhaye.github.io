        <description>I have put together my notes around some of the basic microservices design principles which we must always consider while designing a microservice.
Design principles for MicroServices 1. Develop and Deployed independently Each service should be developed and deployed independently. Deployment of one service should not impact other services and a each service should have it&amp;rsquo;s own code base.
You are doing wrong if
 You find a need to deploy services together You have one code base for multiple services You need to send notification to before you deploy a service  2.</description>
